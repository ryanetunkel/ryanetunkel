An enthusiastic software developer, passionate about video game development. Currently working with Python and Visual Studio Code in the Biomedical Industry, working to transition to a career in professional video game development. 

I pride myself in my problem-solving abilities and coding knowledge, working to expand my skillset further with more languages and a greater understanding of the software development process. I have always been interested in storytelling and creating things for others. Whether it be through writing, making up schoolyard games, coding video games, DMing D&D, I have always had an innate desire to share my creations with the world in the hope that it brings people joy.

Developing hobbyist game experiences using Visual Studio Code with the Python programming language and Pygame library.
